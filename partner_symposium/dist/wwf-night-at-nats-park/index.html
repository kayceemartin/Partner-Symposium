        <h3>Getting to Nats Park </h3>
        <p>Once the reception ends, we'll walk on over to Nationals Park - it's just 10 minutes away. If you need special accommodations, please email  <a href="mailto:staffnews@wwfus.org.">staffnews@wwfus.org</a></p>

        <h3>How do I get my tickets? </h3>

        <p>If your guests paid for their tickets via cash or check, they will be in the same envelope as yours; if they purchased tickets online, they will have received an email at the time of purchase with instructions on how to access their ticket.</p>

        <h3>How will seating work?</h3>
        <p>WWF staff and family and friends, will be seated in sections 231, 233, 235, 237. Seating is open in our sections - ignore seat assignments on tickets.</p> 

        <h3 id="what-to-bring">What to bring to Nats Park:</h3>
        <p>If you’re planning to attend WWF Night at Nats Park, note that the stadium has a strict bag policy. It’s very important you take this into consideration when deciding what to bring for the day.</p>
        <p>For Nats Park, any bag larger than a clutch must be clear plastic, vinyl, or PVC and cannot exceed 16” x 16” x 8”. </p>
        <p>If you have a diaper or medical bag, you of course may bring it. Please use the ADA/family lanes to enter the stadium. Pay-by-the-hour lockers are available at Nats Park for bags that do not comply with regulations on a first come, first served basis. <a href="https://www.mlb.com/nationals/ballpark/information/bag-policy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Read the Washington Nationals Bag Policy</a></p>
        <p><img src="/nationals_bag_options.png" alt="A showcase of small, clear clutces, zip lock bags, and tote bags that allowed at National's Park" /></p>
        <p>Admittedly not very chic, it is permissible to bring your items into the stadium in a gallon-sized zipper bag; we’ll have some on site for you to use, if needed.</p>
        <p>If you’d like to purchase a stadium-approved bag, here are some options:</p>

        <h3>What if it rains?</h3>
